# Welcome to Photon
Photon is a high-level, cross-platform .NET/Mono library for rendering user interfaces in OpenGL-based applications. 

It aims not only to become a cross-platform alternative to WPF (Window Presentation Foundation) but as well to provide it with the full extent of OpenGL. 

It runs on top of the AWESOME <b>OpenTK</b> library (http://www.opentk.com/)
